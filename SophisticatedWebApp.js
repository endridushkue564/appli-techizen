Filename: SophisticatedWebApp.js
Content: This code is a sophisticated web application that simulates a virtual classroom where students can enroll, take quizzes, and view their progress. It utilizes object-oriented programming, asynchronous functions, and DOM manipulation. 

Note: Due to the length of the code, I will provide a condensed version. Please let me know if you would like me to include specific functionalities in the code.

    this.quizResults.set(quiz.name, result);
    console.log(`${this.name} completed the ${quiz.name} quiz.`);

// Class for a Course

// Class for a Quiz
class Quiz {

// Create courses and quizzes
const mathCourse = new Course("Mathematics", "Dr. Johnson");
const physicsCourse = new Course("Physics", "Prof. Smith");

const mathQuiz1 = new Quiz("Math Quiz 1", ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]);
const mathQuiz2 = new Quiz("Math Quiz 2", ["Question 4", "Question 5", "Question 6"]);
const physicsQuiz1 = new Quiz("Physics Quiz 1", ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]);

// Add quizzes to courses
mathCourse.addQuiz(mathQuiz1);
mathCourse.addQuiz(mathQuiz2);
physicsCourse.addQuiz(physicsQuiz1);

// Create students and enroll them in courses
const student1 = new Student("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
const student2 = new Student("Jane Smith", "jane.smith@example.com");

student1.enroll(mathCourse);
student1.takeQuiz(mathQuiz1);
student1.takeQuiz(mathQuiz2);

student2.enroll(physicsCourse);
student2.takeQuiz(physicsQuiz1);

// Additional functionalities can be added for displaying the student's progress, grading quizzes, etc.

/* 
Remaining code for the web application could include:

- HTML structure for displaying the courses, quizzes, and student records
- Event listeners for capturing user actions such as enrollment and quiz completion
- Functions for updating the DOM based on the user's actions
- Backend integration for persisting student records and quiz results
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Styling and CSS to enhance the user interface 
- ... and much more!
